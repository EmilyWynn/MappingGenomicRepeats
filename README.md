# MappingGenomicRepeats
When mapping short read DNA sequences to a reference genome created by long read DNA sequencing, the existence of repeated genomic sequences can cause problems that often require manual correction. This script allows you to quickly identify regions that may have mapping errors due to repeat sequences.
